# How-to-find-if-an-image-is-bright-or-dark
## Idea 
Certain regions of images will be selected to pickup the brightness level and finally averaging those value will give the average brightness level of the image.

>Finally after getting an average brightness level value we can decide a threshold
>below which images will be considered as dark
>one more interesting this is, the code is highly dynamic
>meaning we can modify it to pick only certain percent of points from the image
>for finding averagae brightness values.
>No matter whether the image size is 100X100 pixels or 1000X1000 pixels
>the program is unaffacted by image size.


## External Modules required
```
>> pip install opencv-contrib-python
>> pip install numpy
>> pip install imutils
```
### lets move to the Practical hands on
##### Step 1: Run 'calculate_brightness.py'
You will see output something similar to this
![output](https://github.com/imneonizer/How-to-find-if-an-image-is-bright-or-dark/blob/master/assets/1.jpg)
##### Step 2: Lets try a different image
Simply press esc Key to test on another image that i have provided

>BTW you can place your own images inside the images directory or
>modify the code a little bit to input your own images
>just remove the Parent For loop from line 6
>and change line 8 ``img = cv2.imread(imagePath)`` to ``img = cv2.imread('images/1.png')``

### Actual image High Resolution

### Actual image Low Resolution

### Here is a little code snippet
>to help you understand whats going on behind the scenes
```
#------------------------Reading image--------------------------------------
img = cv2.imread('images/1.png')
img_dot = img

#-----Converting image to LAB Color model----------------------------------- 
lab= cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2LAB)

#-----Splitting the LAB image to different channels-------------------------
l, a, b = cv2.split(lab)

#-----Finding average lightness level in image by fixing some points--------
y,x,z = img.shape #height, width of image
print('>> Image Dimension => X:{}, Y:{}'.format(x,y))
#Now we will decide some dynamic points on image for checking light intensity
l_blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(l, (11, 11), 5)
maxval = []
count_percent = 3 #percent of total image
count_percent = count_percent/100
row_percent = int(count_percent*x) #1% of total pixels widthwise
column_percent = int(count_percent*y) #1% of total pizel height wise
for i in range(1,x-1):
	if i%row_percent == 0:
		for j in range(1, y-1):
			if j%column_percent == 0:
				pix_cord = (i,j)

				cv2.circle(img_dot, (int(i), int(j)), 5, (0, 255, 0), 2)
				img_segment = l_blur[i:i+3, j:j+3]
				(minVal, maxVal, minLoc, maxLoc) = cv2.minMaxLoc(img_segment)
				maxval.append(maxVal)

avg_maxval = round(sum(maxval) / len(maxval))
print('>> Total points: {}'.format(len(maxval)))
print('>> Average Brightness: {}'.format(avg_maxval))
```
>firstly we are converting the image into L*A*B color spaces
>did a slight Gaussian Blurring to cancel out the Noises.
>then splitting it to extract the ``L`` Channel which is responsible for the brightness levels
>after which we calculate number of points we are going to check
>rowise and column wise
>in our case we are taking every 1% pizel out of total pizels
>and finally we detect brightness level at that point
>in the end we just average out all the values
